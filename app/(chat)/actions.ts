** Check if all these fields are present:
- Description: Check if the description is present and assess if it is detailed enough and understandable
- Desired Resolution: Check if the desired resolution is present and assess if it is detailed enough and understandable
- Additional Details: Check if the additional details which can be helpful for the support team to understand the complaint better are present

** CRITICAL: EXPLICIT USER CONFIRMATION REQUIRED
The user MUST have explicitly confirmed they want to proceed with complaint registration. Look for:
- Direct confirmation phrases like: "yes", "correct", "proceed", "submit", "confirm", "that's right", "looks good", "go ahead"
- Responses to questions like "Is this information correct? Should I proceed with registering your complaint?"
- Clear affirmative responses after the assistant presents a complaint summary

** IMPORTANT: Do NOT set isReady to true unless:
1. ALL required information is collected
2. The assistant has presented a summary to the user
3. The user has explicitly confirmed they want to proceed (not just provided more information)

** If the user is still providing additional information, asking questions, or making corrections, set isReady to false

** Return the complaint readiness object with the following fields:
- description: the description of the complaint
- desiredResolution: the desired resolution of the complaint
- additionalDetails: the additional details of the complaint
- isReady: Only return true if ALL information is collected AND the user has explicitly confirmed they want to proceed with registration
